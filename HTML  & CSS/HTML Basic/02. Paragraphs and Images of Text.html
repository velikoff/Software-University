<h1>WHO SHARED THE ELECTRIC CAR?</h1>
<p>Yesterday, one of the more interesting people in <b>Silicon Valley</b> did one of the more interesting things that the car <br>industry has seen in a while. <strong><i>Elon Musk</i></strong>, the C.E.O. of Tesla, opened up all of his patents. “Tesla will not initiate<br> patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology,” he wrote in a blog post. Tesla’s <br>competitors can now freely take advantage of its batteries, chargers, or sunroofs.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk </h2>

<h3>Why ?</h3>
<p><pre>Musk’s</pre> move isn’t entirely <u>unprecedented</u>, either. In 1959, <em>Volvo</em> shared its seat-belt <sup>technology</sup>. In the nineteen seventies, General <sub>Motors</sub> shared innovations on catalytic converters. But what Musk is doing is broader: he’s opening up everything. It’s a risky move but a shrewd one. It’s one that wouldn’t make a lot of sense for a lot of companies. But it does for Tesla. The company’s stock has doubled in the past year, but the industry is struggling. Musk’s biggest electic-car-entrepreneur-frenemy, Shai Agassi, led his company, Better Place, into bankruptcy a year ago. It’s a good moment for the industry to get a jolt.</p>
